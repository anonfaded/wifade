# Wifade

Wifade is an automated bash script tool for Wi-Fi password brute-forcing, designed to work on both Linux and macOS systems. The tool systematically attempts to connect to specified Wi-Fi networks using a list of passwords.

## Purpose
- Educational and ethical security testing of Wi-Fi networks
- Automated testing of multiple SSIDs with configurable password lists
- Demonstration of network security vulnerabilities

## Key Features
- Cross-platform support (Linux and macOS)
- Simple configuration via text files for target SSIDs and passwords
- Visual feedback on connection attempts
- Automated dismissal of authentication dialogs (Linux version)

## Limitations
- Currently requires manual password list configuration
- macOS version has limited testing
- No built-in dictionary attack support (planned for future versions)

## Ethical Usage
This tool is intended for educational purposes and ethical security testing only. Always ensure you have explicit permission to test network security.
