# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Windows PowerShell version of the Wifade Wi-Fi password brute-forcing tool that maintains full feature parity with the existing Linux bash implementation. The Windows version will utilize PowerShell's native networking capabilities and Windows-specific APIs to provide the same automated Wi-Fi testing functionality while adhering to object-oriented programming principles and industry-standard code quality practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security tester using Windows, I want a PowerShell version of Wifade that works identically to the Linux version, so that I can perform Wi-Fi security testing on Windows systems without needing Linux.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Windows PowerShell script is executed THEN the system SHALL provide identical functionality to the Linux bash version
2. WHEN a user runs the PowerShell script with default parameters THEN the system SHALL read from ssid.txt and passwords.txt files
3. WHEN the script attempts Wi-Fi connections THEN the system SHALL use Windows native networking APIs
4. WHEN connection attempts are made THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback identical to the Linux version
5. IF authentication dialogs appear THEN the system SHALL automatically handle them using Windows-specific automation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want the Windows version to follow object-oriented programming principles, so that the code is maintainable, extensible, and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PowerShell script is structured THEN the system SHALL implement classes for core functionality
2. WHEN code is organized THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into distinct classes (NetworkManager, PasswordManager, ConfigurationManager, etc.)
3. WHEN methods are implemented THEN the system SHALL follow single responsibility principle
4. WHEN classes interact THEN the system SHALL use proper encapsulation and abstraction
5. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN the system SHALL use structured exception handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user running the tool on Windows, I want command-line parameter support identical to the Linux version, so that I can customize SSID files, password files, and other options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed with -s parameter THEN the system SHALL accept custom SSID file paths
2. WHEN the script is executed with -w parameter THEN the system SHALL accept custom password file paths
3. WHEN the script is executed with -h parameter THEN the system SHALL display help information
4. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN no parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL use default configuration files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security professional, I want the Windows version to have robust error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain audit trails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN file operations encounter issues THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
3. WHEN Wi-Fi adapter issues occur THEN the system SHALL detect and report adapter status
4. WHEN the script encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle exceptions
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Windows version to automatically detect and work with available Wi-Fi adapters, so that I don't need to manually configure network interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script starts THEN the system SHALL automatically detect available Wi-Fi adapters
2. WHEN multiple adapters are present THEN the system SHALL use the primary Wi-Fi adapter
3. WHEN no Wi-Fi adapter is detected THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN adapter status changes during execution THEN the system SHALL handle the state change gracefully
5. WHEN adapter capabilities are insufficient THEN the system SHALL inform the user of limitations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want both Linux and Windows versions to eventually support compilation to native executables, so that distribution and deployment are simplified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Windows version is complete THEN the system SHALL support compilation to .exe format
2. WHEN the Linux version is refactored THEN the system SHALL support packaging to .deb format
3. WHEN executables are created THEN the system SHALL maintain all original functionality
4. WHEN executables are distributed THEN the system SHALL include necessary dependencies
5. WHEN executables run THEN the system SHALL not require additional runtime installations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security tester, I want enhanced features in both versions that make the tool more comprehensive and unique, so that I have advanced capabilities for Wi-Fi security assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool runs THEN the system SHALL support multiple attack vectors (dictionary, common patterns, etc.)
2. WHEN networks are discovered THEN the system SHALL provide detailed network information (encryption type, signal strength, etc.)
3. WHEN attacks are performed THEN the system SHALL support rate limiting and stealth modes
4. WHEN results are generated THEN the system SHALL export findings to multiple formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
5. WHEN the tool operates THEN the system SHALL include progress tracking and ETA calculations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user concerned about system security, I want the tool to include safety features and ethical usage enforcement, so that it cannot be easily misused for malicious purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool starts THEN the system SHALL display ethical usage warnings and require acknowledgment
2. WHEN suspicious usage patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
3. WHEN the tool operates THEN the system SHALL log all activities for audit purposes
4. WHEN network owners are detected THEN the system SHALL provide options to notify them of vulnerabilities
5. WHEN the tool is distributed THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive legal disclaimers
