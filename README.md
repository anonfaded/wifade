## üöÄ Features

Wifade is a modern, terminal-based WiFi manager with an integrated brute-forcer for Windows (Linux/macOS support coming soon). It offers:

*   **üë®‚Äçüíª Interactive TUI (Text-based UI):** A polished, menu-driven interface for easy navigation and operation.
*   **üì∂ Wi-Fi Management:**
    *   **Scan:** Discover and list all available Wi-Fi networks with details like signal strength, encryption type, and status.
    *   **Connect:** Connect to any Wi-Fi network, including open and password-protected ones.
    *   **Status:** Get a detailed report of your current connection, including private/public IP, gateway, DNS, MAC address, and link speed.
    *   **Control:** Disconnect from networks or restart your Wi-Fi adapter with simple commands.
*   **üîë Integrated Brute-Forcer:**
    *   **Dictionary Attack:** Test network password strength using a built-in wordlist of over 4,700 common passwords.
    *   **Custom Wordlists:** Select and use your own custom password files for targeted testing.
*   **‚ö°Ô∏è Quick CLI Actions:** Bypass the interactive UI for instant results. Use flags to get your IP, scan networks, check status, and more.

*Linux and macOS support is planned and in development. Stay tuned for cross-platform releases!*

## üì¶ Installation (Windows)

1. Go to the [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/anonfaded/wifade/releases) page.

3. Run the installer. It requires administrator privileges to add `wifade` to your system's PATH.
4. Once installed, you can open any terminal and run the `wifade` command, or launch Wifade via the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.

*Linux and macOS installation instructions will be provided when those versions are released.*

Simply run the command without any parameters to launch the full interactive interface.

```sh

## üíÄ Attack Mode

Wifade's password security testing features are accessible from the interactive menu.

1. **Dictionary Attack:** Uses the built-in `probable-v2-wpa-top4800.txt` wordlist. This file contains over 4,700 of the most common WPA passwords.
2. **Custom Password File:** Allows you to use your own wordlist. You can select a `.txt` file using the file picker dialog.

Upon entering Attack Mode for the first time, you will be required to accept an **ethical usage disclaimer**.
